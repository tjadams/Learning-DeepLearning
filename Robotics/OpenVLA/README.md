# OpenVLA
This folder is a project about exploring OpenVLA. It mainly covers setting up a LIBERO environment and calling Huggingface to make OpenVLA inferences in simulation.

## Usage
I've personally set up my own pickagent environment with a bunch of steps.
`conda activate pickagent`

To create your own pickagent conda environment with all the right libraries etc, see my fork here for what I did: https://github.com/tjadams/PickAgent
